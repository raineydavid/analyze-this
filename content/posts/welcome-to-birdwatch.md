People come to Twitter to see whatâ€™s happening in the world. In addition to fun and entertainment, people on Twitter also want credible information that helps them stay informed. As the spread of misleading information continues to evolve, this has been harder to do.

People should be able to easily come away from Twitter feeling well-informed so we are continuing to explore a number of ways to help us scale and tackle the challenges of misleading information. 

From external partnerships with issue area experts and authoritative sources, to providing additional context through the use of labels linked directly to credible information, we want to ensure everyone on Twitter feels empowered to come to their own conclusions about the information they see and engage with.

A new experiment to address misleading information
Today we are introducing a new pilot to test a community based approach to addressing misleading information. A key motivation behind this endeavor is trust - we want the Twitter community to help us build a space where assurance is paramount and helpful context is easy to access. The pilot will also aim to advance the speed and scale of our efforts in this space. 

The Birdwatch pilot will be an iterative study to create a feature that allows participating individuals to submit notes on Tweets they believe contain misleading information. People in the pilot group will see additional context directly on these Tweets. Eventually, our goal is to make those notes visible to everyone on Twitter alongside a voting tool that would allow people to reach consensus around content that is being disputed.  This experiment is building toward a new and different sort of governance on Twitter, one that empowers individuals and the community to access additional remediations like labels or deamplification based on community consensus. . 

We are NOT there yet. In this first phase of this pilot, our goal is to learn.  We plan to observe and think deeply about how we could best bring these tools to life for the entire Twitter community and make Birdwatch a place where everyone can safely weigh in on important topics by providing helpful context.
Our priority is to understand how to build and adopt a community-based approach to misleading information that identifies and highlights the most helpful explanations and trusted sources.
